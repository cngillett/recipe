    <blockquote><p><em>"These are absolutely adorable, pretty easy to make, and the perfect treat to bring to a Halloween party. I brought them to my 2-year-old's school party and they LOVED them, and so did the moms! Use organic apples if possible."</p></em></blockquote>

      <div><h2>Ingredients</h></div>

    <d><li>4 Honeycrisp apples - cored and quartered</li></div>

    <div><li>1 teaspoon lemon juice (optional)</li2></d>

    <div><li> (2.25 ounce) package blanched slivered almonds</li2></d>

    <div><h2>Directions</h2></div>

  <p>With a small, sharp paring knife, cut a lengthwise wedge from the skin side of each apple quarter, leaving

1 the peel around the wedge for lips. If desired, rub the cut portions of the apple quarters with lemon juice

to prevent browning. Poke 5 or 6 slivered almonds into the top and bottom of the cut-out area to make snaggly teeth.</p>
